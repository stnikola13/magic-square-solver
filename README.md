# Magic square solver
A program which uses decision trees to solve a magic square given its initial state. The initial state is an incomplete matrix. The decision tree consists of all possible states of the matrix. The program generates the decision tree and uses it to find a possible solution, either a complete magic square or a complete perfect magic square.
